    "# Analysis of Beam Simulator Images and Brighter-fatter Correction\n",
    "<br>Owner(s): **Andrew Bradshaw** ([@andrewkbradshaw](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/issues/new?body=@andrewkbradshaw))\n",
    "<br>Last Verified to Run: **2018-09-14**\n",
    "<br>Verified Stack Release: **16.0 and 16.0+22 (w_2018_31)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the [brighter-fatter systematic error](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0725) on images of stars and galaxies illuminated on an ITL-3800C-002 CCD at the [UC Davis LSST beam simulator laboratory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5667). Using a series of images at increasing exposure times, we demonstrate the broadening of image profiles on DM stack shape measurements, and a [possible correction method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06273) which iteratively applies a kernel to restore electrons to the pixels from which they were deflected. To keep things simple, for now we skip most DM stack instrument signature removal (ISR) and work on a subset of images which are already processed arrays (500x500) of electrons.\n",

    "1. Characterize and measure objects (stars/galaxies) in LSST beam simulator images\n",
    "2. Test the Brighter-Fatter kernel correction method on those images\n",
    "3. Build your own tests of stack ISR algorithms\n",

    "This brighter fatter correction method takes in a \"kernel\" (derived from theory or flat fields) which models the broadening of incident image profiles assuming the pixel boundary displacement can be represented as the gradient of a scalar field. Given a kernel and this assumption, the incident image profile can in theory be reconstructed using an iterative process, which we test here using our beam simulator images. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06273) and the IsrTask docstring below for more details about the theory and its assumptions. The kernel used here is not generated by the stack but rather through similar code which was written at UC Davis by Craig Lage.

Curiously, some of the objects indicate that the default correction method is properly correcting star-like objects, but over- or under-correcting the effect in galaxy images. This could be due to a violation of some of the underlying assumptions in the method, including the small-pixel approximation or the linearity of kernel correction. Some of the remaining trends could be related to an increase in signal-to-noise in the images, however this is a universally applicable issue with shape measurement and is beyond the scope of this notebook. In some of the figures, a rapid increase in size can be seen at the highest fluxes, indicating saturation of pixel wells which is unrelated to the brighter-fatter effect."
