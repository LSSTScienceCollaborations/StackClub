This is an LSSTC-supported project, to form a small community committed to learning how to use, and explain, the LSST DM Stack. 

We're following a 3-phase plan, which you can read about in more detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103kzjOklSUWo5MJP9B-EsnAdO7V6bstTC_mzBvd0NIk/edit#). Phase 0 is collecting existing tutorials and identifying potential club members from around the LSST Science Collaborations. Then, in Phase 1 (late May 2018 to mid August 2018) we'll work together to turn a subset of those existing "seed" tutorials into community-maintained jupyter notebooks, for display at the August LSST 2018 Project and Community Workshop. Then, we plan to open up to a larger group from the science collaborations starting at the PCW, extending and spinning off the initial set of notebooks. The idea is that the best way to learn something is to try and teach it: if you can write a useful tutorial on part of the DM Stack, you have to understand that part first.

If you have questions, please [write us an issue](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/DMStackClub/issues/new)! 

## Community Tutorials

In progress! Our goal is to build on the existing LSST DM Stack demo and tutorial notebooks to create a set of 
_community-generated, community-oriented_ notebooks that reflect the science interests and expected analyses of 
the LSST Science Collaborations. 

* [List of Topics, with links to tutorial seeds](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSA1uWwTfs9CweatpxF8CEPGBYRY5ZaXB39JzXYE7_U/edit#). Includes comprehensive collection of existing project and community tutorial web pages and demo notebooks, from which seeds are drawn. 
* [Stack Club projects](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/DMStackClub/labels/project) as defined by Stack Club members - follow [this link](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/DMStackClub/labels/project) to see what people are working on. Unassigned projects are available for new members to take on!

| Topic   | Description  | Notebook Location  |
|---|---|---|
| Getting Started  | Basics of using JupyterLab, and contributing to the DM Stack Club repo.  | [DMStackClub/GettingStarted](GettingStarted)  |
| Visualization    | Displaying images and catalogs. | [DMStackClub/Visualization](Visualization)  |
| Image Processing  | From raw images to `calexp`s and `coadd`s.  | [DMStackClub/ImageProcessing](ImageProcessing) |
| SourceDetection  | Detection of sources in images - including low surface brightness galaxies.  | [DMStackClub/SourceDetection](SourceDetection)  |



## Contributing
New Stack Club members: please see the [notes on getting started](GettingStarted/GettingStarted.md) - they'll walk you onto you new LSST Science Platform account, and show you how to work on your tutorial notebooks.

Everyone else: we welcome pull requests! Feel free to fork this repo and send us a pull request. And if you are interested in joining the DM Stack Club, please drop one of us a line, or come and find us in the [#dm-stack-club](https://lsstc.slack.com/messages/C9YRAS4HM) LSSTC Slack channel.
