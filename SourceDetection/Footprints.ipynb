    "In the previous sections, we paid close attention to a fairly bright, isolated sources and their associated footprints that were identified as being above a 10$\\sigma$ threshold. In pratice, especially as we detect with lower thresholds, footprints from a first-pass threshold detection can contain several astronomical objects. This is because the wings of the intensity profiles of individual, but closely packed, sources can bleed into each other, forming one above threshold region, and thus one footprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, pixels which are local maxima in the smoothed image during detection are regarded as peaks, and each peak is assumed to be an astrophysical source. In the subsequent deblending process, the deblender looks at all the peaks in each footprints, and gives them their own deblended child footprint. In addition to identifying realestate to deblended children footprints, the deblender also allocates flux from the parent footprint to its children. As a result, the flux in a deblended heavy footprint will not necessarily equal the flux at the same pixels in its image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will examine footprints that contain more than one peak, and the interplay between footprints, peaks, and deblending. To do so, we will read footprints from data that has already gone through detection, deblending, and measurement. "

    "At first glance, in the animation above it seems the central bright galaxies and fainter smaller sources are successfully deblended. However, as the movie progresses we can see that the bright galaxy is shredded by the deblender. This is a common failure mode of the deblender. There are peaks in the outer wings of the galaxy; the deblender receives this list of peaks and assigns flux to them, creating these wispy looking sources that are inserted into the image. Because the deblender conserves the flux of the parent source, any flux allocated to the whispy sources is flux that cannot be allocated to the main child footprint of the main galaxy."
