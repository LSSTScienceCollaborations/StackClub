    "# Using the LSST Stack Multiband Deblender \n",
    "<br>Owner(s): **Fred Moolekamp** ([@fred3m](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/issues/new?body=@fred3m))\n",
    "<br>Last Verified to Run: **2018-08-17**\n",
    "<br>Verified Stack Release: **w_2018_32**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to illustrate how to execute the multiband deblender (*scarlet*) in the LSST stack. This includes a brief introduction to LSST stack objects including:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Geometry classes from `lsst.geom`, such as points and boxes.\n",
    " - Higher-level astronomical primitives from `lsst.afw`, such as the `Image`, `Exposure`, and `Psf` classes.\n",
    " - Our core algorithmic `Task` classes, including those for source detection, deblending, and measurement.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll be working with coadded images made from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data in the COSMOS field.  We've taken a recent LSST reprocessing of the HSC-SSP UltraDeep COSMOS field (see [this page](https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/S18+HSC+PDR1+reprocessing) for information on that reprocessing, and [this page](https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/) for the data), and added simulated stars from a scaled [SDSS catalog](http://www.sdss.org/dr14/data_access/value-added-catalogs/?vac_id=photometry-of-crowded-fields-in-sdss-for-galactic-globular-and-open-clusters).  The result is a very deep image (deeper than the 10-year LSST Deep-Wide-Fast survey, though not as deep as LSST Deep Drilling fields will be) with both a large number of galaxies and region full of stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on Jim Bosch's globular cluster tutorial, however in it's present state *scarlet* is unable to process the crowded field (most likely) due to poor initial conditions for the sources in the field. So instead we use a region of the image outside of the cluster.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Configure and run the LSST multiband deblender on a test list of objects;\n",
    "2. Understand its task context in the DRP pipeline.\n",

    "The deblender itself sets the `parent` column for each source, which is `0` for objects with no parent, and all of the columns that begin with `deblend_` and also adds new rows to the catalog for each child. It does *not* remove the parent rows it created those child rows from, and this is intentional, because we want to measure both \"interpretations\" of the blend family: one in which there is only one object (the parent version) and one in which there are several (the children). Before doing any science with the outputs of an LSST catalog, it's important to remove one of those interpretations (typically the parent one).  That can be done by looking at the `deblend_nChild` and `parent` fields:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `parent` is the ID of the source from which this was deblended, or `0` if the source is itself a parent.\n",
    " - `deblend_nChild` is the number of child sources this source has (so it's `0` for sources that are themselves children or were never blended).\n",
    " \n",
    "Together, these define two particularly useful filters:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `deblend_nChild == 0`: never-blended object or de-blended child\n",
    " - `deblend_nChild == 0 and parent == 0`: never-blended object\n",
