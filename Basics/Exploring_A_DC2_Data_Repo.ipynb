    "<br>Updated for DC2 by:   Douglas Tucker ([@douglasleetucker](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/issues/new?body=@douglasleetucker)), basically copying the DC2-updated notebook created by **Johann Cohen-Tanugi** ([@johannct](https://github.com/johannct)) in the DESC fork of the Stack Club GitHub repo (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/StackClub).\n",

    "This notebook examines the content of a data repository -- in this particular case, a DC2 data repository -- and shows how to determine the inputs for each component.  A related notebook is \"Exploring an HSC Data Repository,\" which explores the same basic concepts, but using an HSC data repository; this other notebook covers matters in a slightly differ manner, though, and it is useful to explore both notebooks for a fuller understanding of data repositories.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "After working through and studying this notebook you should be able to understand how to use the Butler to figure out: \n",
    "   1. What a data repo is;\n",
    "   2. Which data types are present in a data repository;\n",
    "   3. If coadds have been made, what the available tracts are;\n",
    "   4. Which parts of the sky those tracts cover.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Logistics\n",

The `config` tells us which tasks have been run in the rerun, but metadata describing the results of the run is not propagated back into the registry database in the parent folder.
