    "Catalogs of astronomical objects and their many  measurements will be a primary data product that LSST provides. Queries of those catalogs will be the starting point for almost all LSST science analyses. On the way to filling the LSST database with these catalogs, the science pipelines will generate and manipulate a lot of internal tables; the python class that the Stack defines and uses for these tables is called an \"afwTable\". \n",

    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Make a bare bones afw schema and table;\n",
    "2. Set and get values in a schema and table;\n",
    "3. Navigate large schemas;\n",
    "4. Read and write a source detection catalog table;\n",
    "5. Learn to use source detection catalog methods, and to avoid common pitfalls;\n",
    "6. Learn to use source match vectors.\n",

    "A few comments are in order on questions you may be having about the butler, and the previous cell. First, for the `gen2` butler, there is no good way to know which `dataId`s exist. That means you have to know ahead of time which `dataId`s it makes sense to use. DM fixed this for the `gen3` butler (e.g., one can use the `butler.registry.queryDatasets()` command to find the `dataId`s for different sets of data). Second, the string `'src'` refers to a very specific data product in the DM philosophy, which is a catalog that contains _the results of different measurement algorithms on detected sources on an individual CCD image_. We will meet some other catalogs later in the tutorial. For now, lets get to know this `src` catalog."

Other measurements are associated with previous calibration steps, like identifying sources to be candidates for PSF modeling. If deblending was run, several outputs from the process are stored in the table as well. Other measurement processess, like shape measurement processes, are considered extensions. All of these measurements often have many fields and analagous flag fields associated with them. To get a list of names of these high level processes only, we can provide the `topOnly=True` keyword arguement to the `getNames` method we met earlier in the tutorial."
