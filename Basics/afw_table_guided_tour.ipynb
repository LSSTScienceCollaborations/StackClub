    "Catalogs of astronomical objects and their many  measurements will be a primary data product that LSST provides. Queries of those catalogs will be the starting point for almost all LSST science analyses. On the way to filling the LSST database with these catalogs, the science pipelines will generate and manipulate a lot of internal tables; the python class that the Stack defines and uses for these tables is called an \"afwTable\". \n",

    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Make a bare bones afw schema and table;\n",
    "2. Set and get values in a schema and table;\n",
    "3. Navigate large schemas;\n",
    "4. Read and write a source detection catalog table;\n",
    "5. Learn to use source detection catalog methods, and to avoid common pitfalls;\n",
    "6. Learn to use source match vectors.\n",
