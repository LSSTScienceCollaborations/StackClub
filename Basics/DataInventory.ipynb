    "# Exploring the Shared Datasets in the LSST Science Platform\n",
    "<br>Owner(s): **Phil Marshall** ([@drphilmarshall](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/issues/new?body=@drphilmarshall)), \n",

    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Start figuring out which of the available datasets is going to be of most use to you in any given project; \n",
    "\n",
    "When it is finished, you should be able to:\n",
    "2. Plot the patches and tracts in a given dataset on the sky;\n",
    "3. List the available catalogs in a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "This notebook is intended to be runnable on `lsst-lsp-stable.ncsa.illinois.edu` from a local git clone of https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub.\n",
