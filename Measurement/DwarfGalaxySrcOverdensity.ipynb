    "# Exploring source measurements in a dwarf galaxy\n",
    "<br>Owner(s): **Jeff Carlin** ([@jeffcarlin](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/issues/new?body=@jeffcarlin))\n",

    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Figure out how to find and extract data around a given RA, Dec position;\n",
    "2. Extract a cutout image of an object of interest, and a catalog of sources in the cutout footprint;\n",
    "3. Apply quality cuts to the source catalog, and plot CMDs and spatial maps of sources;\n",
    "4. Diagnose possible problems with the photometry in crowded regions;\n",
    "5. Apply your understanding of the root cause of this problem to re-run photometry with different pipeline processes set up;\n",
    "6. Extract well-measured photometry in the crowded region of interest, and proceed with using these data for science.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the photometry around a dwarf galaxy in the HSC dataset, with a particular interest in extracting scientifically useful photometry for stars in this nearby, partially-resolved galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, we did the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identified the tract and patch containing an object of known coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extracted cutout images and catalogs centered on the identified position, including data from multiple patches if needed. There is a beautiful dwarf galaxy -- KKR 25 -- in the images, which we explored in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plotted a color-magnitude diagram centered on the object of interest. In this particular case, the red giant branch of dwarf galaxy KKR 25 is not evident in the CMD, even though it looks like it _should_ be.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Used a variety of measured quantities from the source catalogs to (a) determine that the stars in KKR 25 are being detected, but just have poor measurements, and (b) to explore why their measurements are all consistent with having zero flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Following the Stack Club \"Footprints\" notebook in the Source Detection section: https://stackclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks.html#source-detection, we looked at source footprints within the KKR 25 region and determined that the issue is that some footprints are _huge_, and that the default behavior of the measurement algorithm(s) to replace neighboring footprints with noise was causing all of the sources to get replaced with noise, too. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Reprocessed a small chunk of data with the flag `doReplaceWithNoise` set to `False`. This allows sources to be measured even in the crowded regions of KKR 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We checked the CMD of this newly-processed dataset, and found that the red giant branch of KKR 25 is clearly visible, and the photometry looks good! From here, we could proceed with our scientific exploration."
