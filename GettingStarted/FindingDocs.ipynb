    "In this notebook we will look at a few different ways to find the documentation on a given DM Stack function or class. \n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Use the jupyter notebook built-in functions to read the docstrings of Stack classes and functions \n",
    "2. Use the `where_is` Stack Club utility to locate DM Stack web documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "This notebook is intended to be runnable on `lsst-lsp-stable.ncsa.illinois.edu` from a local git clone of https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub.\n",

However, to understand the Stack's C++ primitives, we'll need to dig deeper into the DM Stack's [doxygen documentation](http://doxygen.lsst.codes/stack/doxygen/x_masterDoxyDoc/), as linked from https://pipelines.lsst.io.
